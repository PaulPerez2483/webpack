## Webpack and Babel

Tool we will be using :

[webpack, webpack-cli] : Modules :: allow us to use our jS in a similar way we use modules as supposed of having everything in one file

npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-dev :: not needed in our application when it runs - only to process the JS files.

--mode-development : flag

./node_modules/.bin/webpack --mode=development :: will try to run a /src/filename.js

--save-dev
[@babel/core, @babel/preset-react, babel-loader] : JSX ::

[react, react-dom] react libraries

--save-dev :
webpack
webpack-cli
@babel/core
@babel/preset-react
babel-loader
react
react-dom

## FrontEnd Setup
